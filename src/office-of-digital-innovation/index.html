            <h2>What we’re building</h2>

            <p>Too often, government services don’t actually meet the needs of the people who use them. California Office of Digital Innovation (ODI) will work to change that by putting  residents’ needs at the heart of state services. Whether it’s homelessness, housing, wildfires, or any one of the serious issues facing California, ODI will partner with innovators across the state to deliver radically better services.  </p>
