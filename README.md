## Building

### Prerequisites

- install <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a>
- run ```npm install```

### Build command

```npm run build```

Concatenates, minifies and removes unused CSS.

### Files only in /public

Some static files are only present in the public folder and are set to be ignored by the webpack clean plugin which deletes stuff in there with every build:

- web.config (webserver configuration)
- robots.txt
- sitemap.xml

Concatenates, minifies and removes unused CSS, builds template partials.
