We're reimagining CA.gov with and for the people of California.

Our first step: Make CA.gov easier for Californians to use. We're working to help you access the services and information you need.

And we invite you to join us.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- install <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a>
- run ```npm install```

### Build command

```npm run build```

Concatenates, minifies and removes unused CSS.

### Translations

We are using a google spreadsheet as the datasource for our content strings because it has a cool integrated formula to provide automatic translation values we can use while we wait for our human translators to review. The spreadsheet is at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pjhiNZQtlb1KCrkdMTbYcvzhZkffNQpG5ekpmAU_SkM/edit#gid=0 and is accessible to alpha members. We publish the strings publicly when the spreadsheet is changed. To pull in new translations:

- Add your new strings to the google spreadsheet
- Run the command: ```npm run gimmetranslations``` to pull the latest translation strings into the local file system
- Run the build command to regenerate the site with latest translations: ```npm run build```
- Checkin the updated src/lang-global.csv along with your file updates so the builds run on the server which do not pull latest translation strings will run with latest content.

### Files only in /public

Some static files are only present in the public folder and are set to be ignored by the webpack clean plugin which deletes stuff in there with every build:

- web.config (webserver configuration)
- robots.txt
- sitemap.xml

Concatenates, minifies and removes unused CSS, builds template partials.
